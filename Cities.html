    <br><i>"The people who live in a small community, lives in a much larger world. They know much more of the fierce variety and uncompromising divergences of others…In a large community, we can choose our companions. In a small community, our companions are chosen for us. Thus in all extensive and highly civilized society groups come into existence founded upon sympathy, and shut out the real world more sharply than the gates of a monastery. There is nothing really narrow about the clan; the thing which is really narrow is the clique."</i></p>
